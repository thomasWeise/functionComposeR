Title: R Package for Composing and Canonicalizing Functions
Version: 0.8.5
Author: Dr. Thomas Weise <tweise@hfuu.edu.cn>
Maintainer: Dr. Thomas Weise <tweise@hfuu.edu.cn>
Description: This package provides four functions, namely
   \code{expression.simplify}, which attempts to resolve as many sub-expressions of
   an expression as possible, \code{function.canonicalize}, which tries to resolve
   the promises and variables inside a function, \code{function.substitute},
   which substitutes a specified subset of the formal parameters of a function
   with specified values, yielding a function of smaller arity, and
   \code{function.compose} which combines/chains two functions together.
   The goal is to be able to produce readable and quick-to-evaluate functions,
   in particular to be able to compose functions iteratively without creating
   more and more complex entities that depend on different environments and are
   largely opaque. With this package, you can retain readble functions with
   as many variables substituted by constants and sub-expressions evaluated to
   constants as possible, which should also speed up the computation of the
   functions.
   Additionally, the functions try to replace identical sub-expressions by the
   same object. This can potentially make the function execution more cache
   friendly.
   Still, please be aware that this is a hacked-together early draft version
   of the package (as indicated by the version number). There may be many
   border cases where it produces nonsense. Please carefully test whether it
   does exactly what you want before using it.
